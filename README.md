# Simulating the Stern-Gerlach Experiment with Basic Python Tools

This project demonstrates how to simulate the iconic Stern-Gerlach experiment using only basic Python libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib) and fundamental numerical methods. The goal is to show that you can model sophisticated quantum experiments without expensive commercial software or specialized equipment.

## Overview

The Stern-Gerlach experiment, first performed in 1922 by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach, provided the first direct experimental evidence of space quantization—the idea that angular momentum is quantized in quantum mechanics. When a beam of silver atoms passes through a non-uniform magnetic field, the beam splits into discrete spots on a detector, revealing that atomic spin can only take certain discrete values.

This simulation replicates the experiment by:
1. **Generating a realistic atomic beam** of silver atoms with thermal velocities
2. **Solving for the magnetic field** using finite difference methods
3. **Tracking particle trajectories** through the magnet and slits
4. **Observing the quantized splitting** at the detector

## How It Works

### 1. Magnetic Field Calculation (`fe_laplace_solver.py`)

The magnetic field is generated by solving Laplace's equation using a simple **finite difference method** (Jacobi iteration). The magnet geometry is approximated as:
- A sharp wedge at the top (positive potential)
- A grooved block at the bottom (negative potential)

This creates the characteristic "eye-shaped" field pattern of the Stern-Gerlach magnet. The solver uses a 400×400 grid and iterates until convergence, then computes the field components via numerical gradients.

**Key insight**: Instead of using finite element software (like COMSOL), we solve the same physics problem with ~50 lines of Python using basic numerical methods.

### 2. Particle Simulation (`solve_stern_gerlach.py`)

The simulation tracks millions of silver atoms through the experiment:

- **Initialization**: Atoms start at the oven position with:
  - Thermal velocity distribution (T = 1300 K)
  - Random spin orientations (±1)
  - Geometric velocity selection to aim at the slit

- **Velocity filtering**: Only atoms within a narrow velocity window (~675 m/s ± 75 m/s) are kept, mimicking velocity selection in the real experiment

- **Slit interaction**: Atoms pass through a rectangular slit (0.8 mm × 35 μm) that collimates the beam

- **Magnetic deflection**: Inside the magnet region, atoms experience a force:
  ```
  F = μ · ∇B
  ```
  where μ is the magnetic moment (proportional to spin) and ∇B is the field gradient. This causes spin-up and spin-down atoms to deflect in opposite directions.

- **Detection**: Final positions are recorded at the detector plane, showing the characteristic two-spot pattern

### 3. Computational Efficiency

The code uses several optimizations:
- **Lazy loading**: The magnetic field solver runs only once when first needed
- **Interpolation**: Field values are pre-computed on a grid and interpolated during simulation
- **Vectorized operations**: NumPy arrays enable efficient batch processing of millions of atoms

## Running the Simulation

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

### Execution

```bash
python solve_stern_gerlach.py
```

The simulation will:
1. Initialize 5 million silver atoms
2. Filter to ~hundreds of thousands based on velocity
3. Track trajectories through the experiment
4. Display a scatter plot showing the final positions colored by spin state

Expected runtime: A couple of minutes on a laptop (the field solver runs once, then the particle tracking is fast).

## Results

The output shows the characteristic Stern-Gerlach splitting:
- **Two distinct spots** on the detector (one for spin-up, one for spin-down)
- **Separation** in the z-direction (perpendicular to the beam and field gradient)
- **Quantized behavior**: All atoms end up in one of two discrete positions, not a continuous distribution

## Why This Matters

This project demonstrates that:
- **Complex physics can be simulated with simple tools**: No need for COMSOL, ANSYS, or other expensive software
- **Fundamental methods are powerful**: Finite difference methods date back to the 1800s but still solve modern problems
- **Accessibility**: Anyone with Python and basic physics knowledge can explore physics simulations computationally

The simulation uses the same underlying physics as commercial finite element software, just implemented in a more accessible way. The magnetic field solver uses the same Laplace equation that COMSOL solves, and the particle tracking uses the same classical mechanics that any physics simulation uses.

## Code Structure

- `fe_laplace_solver.py`: Solves Laplace's equation for the magnetic field using finite differences
